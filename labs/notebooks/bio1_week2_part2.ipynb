    "We have included web links were appropriate to additional information and web based resrouces that can be used to either replace or complement working in the Python environment. It is absolutely fine to use web based tools to perform Bioinformatic work, but those tools are often limited in their functionality in ways that eventually become problematic in real-life anaysis situations. This is why, if you would like to pursue further study and/or research in Bioinformatics and related disciplines it is a good plan to begin learning the two core programming languages that are in common use, namely [Python](https://www.learnpython.org) and the Statistical programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org)."
