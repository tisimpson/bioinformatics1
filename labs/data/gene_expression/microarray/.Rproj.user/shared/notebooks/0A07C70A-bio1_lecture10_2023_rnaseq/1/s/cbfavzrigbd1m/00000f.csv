"0","# DESeq2's statistical model relies on understanding the relationship between the gene count data's variance and its mean. The next step estimates the relationship"
"0","# between the mean normalised counts and their ""dispersion"" (that is, the squared coefficient of variation = the standard deviation divided by the mean, all "
"0","# squared). Dispersion can be understood as follows - if a gene's expression varies from replicate to replicate by 20%, its dispersion is 0.2*0.2=0.04."
"0","# The function estimateDispersions() performs three steps:"
"0","# - (i) it estimates a dispersion value for each gene (which value may itself have a large sampling variance due to the limited number of samples it is calculated from)"
"0","# - (ii) it fits a curve through these estimates,"
"0","# - (iii) for each gene it ""shrinks"" the noisy gene-wise dispersion estimates towards the consensus represented by the fitted curve (though outliers, with large dispersion estimates, are left unchanged"

"0","# We can view the per-gene dispersion estimates and the fitted curve using the plotDispEsts() function. Black dots are the original gene-wise dispersion estimates, "
"0","# the red line is the fitted curve, and the blue dots are the final ""shrunken"" dispersion estimates. Black dots surrounded by blue circles are the outliers whose dispersion estimate was not altered."
